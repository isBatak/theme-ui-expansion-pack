# Using Theme UI without MDX

The `theme-ui` package supports treeshaking, and can generally be used with or without MDX.
If you'd like finer-grained control over your application's bundle and do not need to use MDX, you can install the `@theme-ui/core` package instead.

```sh
npm i @theme-ui/core
```

This package includes only a subset of the features of Theme UI and lacks support for MDX, color modes, and base global styles.
Use the `jsx` function and `ThemeProvider` component from this package for a bare-bones Theme UI setup.
