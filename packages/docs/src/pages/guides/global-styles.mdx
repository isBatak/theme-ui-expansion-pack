# Global Styles

Use the Emotion `Global` component to add global CSS with theme-based values.

By default, the `ThemeProvider` component will apply styles in `theme.styles.root` to the `<body>` element.
It will also apply `color` and `background-color` styles based on `theme.colors.text` and `theme.colors.background` respectively.

<Note>
Generally, you should try to avoid adding CSS to global scope.
Many styles can be safely encapsulated into a component without the need for global styles.
</Note>

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Global } from '@emotion/core'

export default props =>
  <Global
    styles={theme => ({
      *: {
        boxSizing: 'border-box',
      }
    })}
  />
```
