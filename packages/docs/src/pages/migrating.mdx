# Migration Guides

## v0.3

### What's New

- Components can now be imported directly from the `theme-ui` package. Be sure that treeshaking is enabled with your build tool.
- Includes smart defaults for adding base styles to the `<body>` element.
- Simplified color modes API.
- New `@theme-ui/css`, `@theme-ui/core`, `@theme-ui/color-modes`, and `@theme-ui/mdx` packages allow for more bespoke ways to use the library.

### Breaking Changes

- `@emotion/core` and `@mdx-js/react` are now dependencies of `theme-ui` and should not be installed separately. If you'd like to use a particular version of each library, use [Yarn resolutions](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/selective-version-resolutions/).
- Theme UI context no longer provides `context.components`. If you're using this object from context, use the MDX hook instead. E.g. `import { useMDXComponents } from '@mdx-js/react'`
- If you'd like color mode to be initialized from the `prefers-color-scheme` media query, you must enable the `useColorSchemeMediaQuery: true` flag in your theme.
- The `ColorMode` component is deprecated and no longer required to add color styles to the `<body>` element.
- The following components have been removed in favor of using `Box` and `Flex` components: `Layout`, `Header`, `Main`, `Footer`
- The `initialColorMode` flag no longer works, use `initialColorModeName` instead.
- The `ThemeProvider` now adds global typographic styles to the `<body>` element based on `theme.styles.root`. To disable this behavior set the `useBodyStyles: false` flag in your theme.
- Theme context is now stateless. If you've made use of `context.setTheme`, this no longer works. An alternative approach is available with the `@theme-ui/editor` package.
- The `ThemeStateProvider` component is no longer avialable, see `@theme-ui/editor` as an alternative.
- The `@theme-ui/editor` package has a completely new API. Please refer to the package's [README.md](https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui/blob/master/packages/editor/README.md) for more information.

## v0.2

### JSX Pragma

If you were using the Theme UI custom JSX pragma, rename the `css` prop to `sx`. This does not apply if you were importing and using the `css` utility function manually.

### `theme-ui-typography`

If you were using the `theme-ui-typography` package, install the new package named `@theme-ui/typography` instead.
The `toStyle` API is no longer included. Use the `toTheme` API instead, see the [Typography.js docs](/styling-mdx/#typographyjs) for how to use this utility.

### `Box` and layout component

If you were using Styled System style props on the `Box` component or any other layout component, replace these props with either the [`sx` prop](/sx-prop) or by using the `css` utility.

### Other

- Replace `ColorModeProvider` and `ComponentProvider` with the `ThemeProvider` component.
- The `@emotion/styled` package is no longer required for Theme UI. If you are not using it directly in your application, you can remove it from your dependencies.
